Gender Guess Analysis
Overview
Gender Guess Analysis is a project that uses the gender-guesser library to predict gender based on names. This repository includes code and resources for integrating and analyzing gender prediction using the gender-guesser library.

Features
Gender Prediction: Use the gender-guesser library to predict gender from names.
Data Analysis: Analyze name datasets to understand gender distribution.
Visualization: Generate plots and graphs to visualize gender prediction results.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ashi2419/gender-guess-analysis.git
cd gender-guess-analysis
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python packages, including gender-guesser, using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure gender-guesser is included in your requirements.txt file. If not, you can install it separately:

bash
Copy code
pip install gender-guesser
Usage
Predict Gender:

To predict gender for a list of names, use the provided script. Create a names.txt file with one name per line and run:

bash
Copy code
python predict_gender.py --input names.txt --output predictions.csv
This will generate a predictions.csv file with names and their predicted genders.

Analyze Predictions:

For basic analysis of prediction results, use:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_predictions.py --input predictions.csv
Generate Visualizations:

To create visualizations based on prediction results, run:

bash
Copy code
python visualize.py --input predictions.csv --output plots/
Configuration
predict_gender.py: Modify this script if you need to change the input/output file paths or adjust prediction settings.
analyze_predictions.py: Customize the analysis as needed to suit your data and requirements.
